This app is for those who dont pay attention to their phones and then panic on seeing n miscalls.(like me)

The aim is to catch your attention in weird and quirky ways(eg: random vibration buzzes, flash-flickering, emails, etc.) when you have miscalls from a predefined list of contacts (eg. family, friends,etc.)
